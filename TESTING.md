## Quick Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Multiple Users Simultaneously
1. **Open multiple browser tabs/windows** (or use different browsers)
2. **Navigate to the website** in each tab
3. **Add different products** to cart in each tab
4. **Notice each tab has its own cart** (session isolation working)
5. **Place orders simultaneously** from different tabs
6. **Check that each order gets unique IDs** with different session identifiers

### Test 2: Inventory Management
1. **Add items to cart** in one tab
2. **In another tab**, try to add the same item
3. **Notice real-time stock updates** (stock badges update)
4. **Try to add more items than available** - should show error
5. **Wait 30 seconds** - inventory may decrease due to simulated other users

### Test 3: Order Rate Limiting
1. **Place one order** successfully
2. **Try to place another order immediately** - should show cooldown message
3. **Wait 30 seconds** and try again - should work

### Test 4: Error Handling
1. **Try submitting order without filling required fields** - should show validation errors
2. **Enter invalid email format** - should show email validation error
3. **Enter invalid phone number** - should show phone validation error

### Test 5: Cart Persistence
1. **Add items to cart**
2. **Refresh the page** - cart should remain
3. **Close browser and reopen** - cart should remain for 24 hours
4. **Open in different browser** - should have separate cart
